I was responsible for designing and building the frontend of a Esports Tournament web app using Svelte and TypeScript. I had a blast working on this project. I learned a lot about accessibility, performance optimization and designing and building a custom UI library. Also worked a lot on my technical support skills and engaged with community members about ongoing and upcoming Atlantic eSports
events.
